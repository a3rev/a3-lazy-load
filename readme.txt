Use a3 Lazy Load for images, videos, iframes. Instantly improve your sites load time and dramatically improve site users experience.

== DESCRIPTION ==

a3 Lazy Load is a Mobile Oriented, very simple to use plugin that will speed up sites page load speed. The more content heavy your site the better the plugin will perform and the more you will see the improvements in performance. See [this demo](http://ressio.github.io/lazy-load-xt/demo/stresstest1000img.htm) of a page with 1,000 images (yes 1,000 images) to load.

a3 Lazy Load is inspired by and powered by the ressio [Lazy-Load-xt JavaScript](https://github.com/ressio/lazy-load-xt).

a3 Lazy Load is the most fully featured, incredibly easy to set up lazy load plugin for WordPress. Use the plugins admin settings to easily define what elements are lazy loaded and when they become visible in the users browser. As the user scrolls down the page the next lot of elements you have applied lazy Load to are only loaded as they become visible in the view port.

= 100% COMPATABLE WITH WORDPRESS 5.5 =

WordPress 5.5 introduced lazy loading for all images uploaded to a siteâ€™s media library. a3 Lazy Load Image options work side-by-side with this, but then enhances it by lazy loading all the images loaded from outside of the media library or on older browsers that do not support the new WP attribute. 

= IMAGE LAZY LOAD =

Images are the number one element that slows page load and increases bandwidth use. From the a3 Lazy Load admin panel turn load images by a3 Lazy Load ON | OFF. For more flexibility when ON you can choose to ON | OFF lazy load for images in

* Post, Pages and Custom Post Types (All Content areas)
* Widgets (Sidebar, header and footer)
* Apply to post thumbnails
* Apply to gravatars

= HORIZONTAL SCROLL =

Supports lazy loading of images in containers that use horizontal scroll. The admin Images options has a section where you enter the classname or ID of the container that uses horizontal scroll.

= MORE THAN JUST IMAGES =

= VIDEO LAZY LOAD =

a3 Lazy Load supports all WordPress video Embeds including Youtube, Vimeo and HTML5 video - for a full list see the [WordPress Codex Embeds](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) list. The WordPress embed method of copying and pasting the video url into posts and pages content area is fully supported. 

<strong>Note</strong> - Works with Videos added by Text and HTML Widgets but not the new WordPress Video widget. That widget does not pull iframe at first load, it uses JavaScript to replace html to iframe and hence a3 lazy Load can't see it to apply.  

From the a3 lazy Load admin panel turn Video Support ON | OFF. When ON you can choose to ON | OFF lazy load for videos in

* Video embeded by URL in Post and Pages (All Content areas)
* Video in Widget types, Text Widget and HTML Widgets.
* Youtube [see demo](http://ressio.github.io/lazy-load-xt/demo/youtube-iframe.htm)
* Video [see demo](http://ressio.github.io/lazy-load-xt/demo/video-html5.htm)
* Fully Compatible with the popular [Youtube Embed Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/youtube-embed/)

= iFRAME LAZY LOAD =

a3 Lazy Load has built in support for content that is added by iframe from any source in content and widgets. Examples

* WordPress embedded media
* Facebook Like boxes with profiles, Like buttons, Recommend
* Google+ Profile
* Google Maps

= POST EMBED =

* Fully compatible with WordPress embed post on any site feature introduced in version WP version 4.4
* Makes embed post load much faster

= WORDPRESS AMP =

* Built in auto support for WordPress AMP plugin
* Built in support for Better AMP plugin
* There are no setting options for exclude /amp - Lazy Load is just never applied to the /amp endpoint
* When the url is loaded in browser without /amp Lazy Load is applied 

= JETPACK SITE ACCELERATOR (Photon) =

This is an option that you turn on as the Jetpack Accelerator (Photon CDN images) has its own lazy load feature that needs to be OFF first to be able use a3 Lazy Load as your lazy Load engine. Some users prefer to use a3 Lazy Load as it applies Lazy Load to videos and iframes as well as images.

= WebP IMAGES =

a3 Lazy Load has built in automatic support for WebP images. There are no settings for this as a3 Lazy Load will automatically detect if an image has a WebP version and lazy load the WebP version. If no WebP image exists, the appropriate jpg or png version will be lazy loaded. Also fully support browser detection of WebP.


= LAZY LOAD EFFECTS =

a3 Lazy Load gives you the option to lazy load images with a FADE IN or SPINNER effect

* FADEIN [see demo](http://ressio.github.io/lazy-load-xt/demo/fadein.htm)
* SPINNER [see demo](http://ressio.github.io/lazy-load-xt/demo/spinner.htm)
* Option to create a custom Lazy Load pre-load background colour


= PERFORMANCE TWEAKS =

a3 Lazy Load gives you the option to load its script from your sites HEAD or from the FOOT.

* Note that your theme must have the wp_footer() function if you select FOOTER load.
* Note the plugin CSS is always loaded from the HEAD.

= EXCLUDE IMAGES & VIDEO =

a3 Lazy Load allows you to easily exclude any image or video by class name from having the Lazy Load effect applied. [See FAQ's](https://wordpress.org/plugins/a3-lazy-load/#faq-header) 

= JAVASCIPT DISABLED FALLBACK =

a3 Lazy Load has built in Noscript fallback if user has JavaScript turned off in their browser. Developers who use underscore.js in their applications can use the Noscript parameter to exclude their plugins content from Lazy Load.

= THEME & PLUGIN COMPATIBILITY =

a3 Lazy Load works with any WordPress theme that follows the WordPress Theme Codex. However, many Theme & Plugin developers will use a custom written function to add objects, example the theme has a home page with layout created by a custom function they have written. a3 Lazy Load cannot know what these functions are and so cannot apply to the objects loaded by that custom function.

If your images or objects not being Lazy Loaded in a certain section of your site, but are Lazy Loaded everywhere else you will know this is the cause. Please if this happens raise a support ticket with the developer, explaining that they just need to add a simple tag to their custom functions so that a3 Lazy Load apply to their custom function and be fully compatible. [Here is a list](https://wordpress.org/plugins/a3-lazy-load/#faq-header) of a3 lazy Load filter tags to include in your ticket to make it easy for the developer.

Don't forget when a developer does add full compatibility with a3 Lazy Load please let us know via a support ticket on this forum and we will add them to the list below.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I exclude individual objects from Lazy Load? =

Images, Videos / iframes can be excluded from Lazy Load by existing classnames or if none exist exclusions can be done manually via exclusion <code>skip-lazy</code> classname or <code>data-skip-lazy</code> attribute. Examples
Exclude by classname <code>&#x3C;img class="skip-lazy"&#x3E; , &#x3C;video class="skip-lazy"&#x3E;</code>
Exclude by attribute <code>&#x3C;img data-skip-lazy&#x3E; , &#x3C;video data-skip-lazy&#x3E;</code>

= Why are some images, videos, objects not Lazy Loaded? =

a3 Lazy Load can only be applied to objects that are added using core WordPress functions. If your theme or a plugin developer adds objects such as images or videos via a custom written function, a3 lazy Load cannot know what that custom function is and hence cannot Lazy Load the object.

So if you see object not being lazy loaded please check first if those objects are loaded by the theme or a plugin. If they are, you can be confident that they are loaded by a custom function. 

If this is the case, please help yourself and other a3 lazy Load users by raising a support ticket with the developer and ask them to add an a3 Lazy Load filter tag to their function to allow a3 Lazy Load to find it and apply to the object. 

Below is a list of available a3 Lazy Load filters to use and pass onto the developer.

= Filter tags to apply lazy load =

Apply lazy load for images in content.
<code>a3_lazy_load_images</code> 
Example:
<code>apply_filters( 'a3_lazy_load_images', $your_content, null );</code>

Apply lazy load for videos and iframe from content.
<code>a3_lazy_load_videos</code> 
Example:
<code>apply_filters( 'a3_lazy_load_videos', $your_content, null );</code>

Apply lazy load for all images, videos and iframe from content
<code>a3_lazy_load_html</code>
Example:
<code>apply_filters( 'a3_lazy_load_html', $your_content, null );</code>

= Filter Tags to Exclude by Theme Class name =

Filter tags to add to class name of theme to exclude lazy load on images or videos.
<code>a3_lazy_load_skip_images_classes</code>
<code>a3_lazy_load_skip_videos_classes</code>
